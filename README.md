Determining the Likelihood of a COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Audio Data and Ensemble Machine Learning 

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and a fellow student in my graduate course. Our primary objective was to enhance an existing Stanford Class project by implementing innovative improvements. We dedicated a substantial period of 3 months to conceptualize the idea, gather data, develop code, iterate on our work, and produce a comprehensive paper.

To gain deeper insights into our project, we invite you to explore our detailed paper, which encompasses a comprehensive analysis of our process, findings, and outcomes. Additionally, we have included the raw data used in our research, as well as the code and ensemble we developed.

Feel free to delve into the following resources:

Paper: Our comprehensive paper provides an in-depth exploration of our project, offering valuable insights into our methodology, results, and conclusions.
Raw Data: We have included the raw data we utilized for our research, enabling further analysis and exploration.
Code and Ensemble: This repository contains the codebase and our ensemble implementation, showcasing the technical aspects of our project.
